            <p class="text-white">Set over 472 hectares, Chasewater Country Park supports a mosaic of habitats, including wetlands and lowland heath. In 1988, these nationally important habitats led to the Chasewater Heaths area being designated as a Site of Special Scientific
                Interest (SSSI). In 2011, this was extended to include almost the entire Country Park, plus the 90-hectare reservoir and nearby canal. <br><br> As well as supplying the Canals and Rivers Trust with essential water to maintain levels in
                the Birmingham canal network, Chasewater reservoir is also a hub for water sports lovers. If you enjoy water-skiing, wakeboarding, sailing and more, youâ€™re in the right place!<br><br>The habitats and species of Chasewater and Chasewater
                are interlinked, due to their proximity. To explore them both, pick up a guide for Chase2Water, our new 7-mile-long walking route, which connects both sites.</p>
